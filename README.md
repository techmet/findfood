# findfood

Find food is a light weight restaurant search app which is built using react, material-ui, nodejs and zomato developer API.

### Assumptions

* When user chooses a location, all the search results will be shown specific to that location.
* User doesn't use both searches simultaneously.
* Order details means the full details of the restaurant.
* On initial load the results should be displayed for current location.  
* App should be responsive means the app should look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).

### Development

* Clone this repository.
* Run `yarn install`
* Run dev watch builds- `yarn start`

To create a build, run `yarn build`.

Note: 
* If you have trouble in running the application using `yarn start` from the root folder, please try by running `yarn start` in both client and server folder separately.
